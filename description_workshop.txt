[h3]A mod based on the video "How to Fix Terraria's Mage Class" by Terraria Youtuber Throarbin.[/h3]

I decided to make this mod because I also love playing Mage and found the ideas interesting. Also because I'm a fan of Throarbin.

[h1]Features:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Gem Hoods, with set bonuses that buff their respective staffs.
    [*]The Jeweler's Staff and the Aristocrat's Staff, multicolor staffs made from combining pre-existing gem staffs. They shoot multiple projectiles!
    [*]Miniature mana bar over your character's head when your mana is less than full to help you better keep track of your mana in the heat of battle.
    [*]Magic Cloak, a pre-boss accessory that grants more damage the more mana you have left.
    [*]Mana Knuckles, a tinker of the Mana Flower and the Flesh Knuckles intended for the 'tank mage'.
    [*]Mana Field, a rare drop from enchanted swords that grants a small amount of mana back when hitting an enemy in close range.
    [*]Star Band, a branch of the Band of Starpower that makes enemies drop stars when damaged instead of when killed.
    [*]Magic Glove, an accessory made from Feral Claws that boosts the velocity of magic projectiles.
[/list]

[h1]Rebalance:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Demon Scythe and Flower of Fire swap places, and Flower of Fire gets nerfed.
    [*]Jungle Armor is now post evil-boss (scales/tissues needed in recipe now)
    [*]Magnet Flower has been removed and replaced with the Flower Emblem, a tinker of the Celestial Emblem and the Mana Flower.
    [*]Gem staffs can now be crafted with either ore of the same tier (ex. gold can make both diamond and ruby staffs)
    [*]Wand of Sparking is now craftable with 8 wood and 45 torches. Its place in surface chests has been replaced with more aglets.
[/list]

[b][i]NOTE: There are many times in the original video where Throarbin specifies boosting something by a specific amount (ex. Mana Field gives 10% of mana used back, Magic Glove boosts velocity by 10%). After testing these, I felt that 10% was too weak and so I buffed them to 25%. If you would like to see these statted the exact way they are presented in the video, there is a config option to do such a thing and switch the balance.[/i][/b]

[i]I was not commisioned by Throarbin to make this mod, and it is not officially afilliated with him.[/i]
